# Python Data Structures & Algorithms

This repository is dedicated to Python data structures and algorithms for learning purposes. This youtube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWVWeAqZ0WU) is an awesome resource to learn graph algorithms specifically. 

**What is a graph?**
Graph = Nodes + Edges

Where a, b, c, d, e, and f are nodes and edges are the connections between the nodes. Nodes are vertices are interchangeably used. There can be many edges between the nodes.
