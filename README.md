# Python Data Structures & Algorithms

This repository is dedicated to Python data structures and algorithms for learning purposes. This youtube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWVWeAqZ0WU) by Alvin Zablan is an awesome resource to learn graph algorithms specifically. Alvin explains the approach to a problem fluently and makes graph solution implementation like a piece of cake. 

**What is a graph?**

Graph = Nodes + Edges

Where a, b, c, d, e, and f are <ins> nodes </ins> and <ins> edges </ins> are the connections between the nodes. Nodes are vertices are interchangeably used. There can be many edges between the nodes. 

Graphs can be cyclic and/or acyclic where:

<ins> cyclic </ins>  = A path in the nodes where we can get back where we started from.

<ins> acyclic </ins>  = Where there is no such path. Or in other words there is only a certain direction to follow. 

Cyclic and acyclic are also known as directed and undirected, respectively. However, graphs can have cycle as well as a specific direction within it's nodes. 

**Breadth First Traversal**

A BFS traversal will explore nodes in all the directions evenly. As show here ![alt text](https://github.com/monika0603/glowing-spork/blob/main/graphs/BFS.png)
